# stretching-app
This Pygame app cycles through `stretch` and `relax` timers to give the user an audible feedback on when you relax and when to stretch.

There are four main timers in this app, `small_timer`, `medium_timer`, `large_timer` and a `break_timer`.
Any of these can easily be editted to fit your personal need. (seconds * 1000)

When the app starts, it'll begin to cycle from a `rest` to a `small`, back to `rest`, `medium`, back to `rest`, and finally `large` before repeating.
When each of these cycles begin, a sound effect is accompanied with them.
